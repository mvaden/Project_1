Instructions on how to play:
1. Upon loading the page, you are presented with the home (main screen). This is a single page app, so no need to worry about navigating outside of this page (not including the link to this repo at the bottom.)

2. For each question, place your answer in the input. Click the 'submit' button. Note: For now, answers are all case sensitive until further updates to code are committed.

3. After clicking 'submit', an alert will pop up on the screen, returning the feedback from one of two arrays regarding your answer.

4. After the fifth input, the game is over.

5. At the bottom of the page, there is a href link that takes you back to this repository.
